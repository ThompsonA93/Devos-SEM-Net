# Data Converter
Simple script to convert from CSV to TTL for later imports.


## Troubleshooting / Errors
Use the CSV-To-JSON Converter, or fill JSON-LD individually.

Using raw JSON-LD doesn't seem to be renderable, given @-annotations being recognized syntax errors -- See data.json__old.

Preprocessing of illegal characters before rendering possible.

Was still not able to render -- Value was then either undefined or non-existant, even if Object with key: Value was detected.
